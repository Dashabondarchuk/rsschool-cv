### About me
My journey began with a course in design [WAY UP](https://wayup.in/). There was a small part of the course on layout, and then I realized that I like layout. Then I study on my own through videos, websites. I also have a physical specialty where programming is applied. I am purposeful and ready to learn new things!No work experience. There are two examples of work: I made one [site](https://dashabondarchuk.github.io/site/) on the Way Up course,the other [site](https://dashabondarchuk.github.io/new/) for experience (the site was not completed to the end)
